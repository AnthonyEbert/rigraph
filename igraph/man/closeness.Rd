\title{Closeness centrality of vertices}
\description{Cloness centrality measures how many steps a it is required
  to access the every other vertex from a given vertex.}
\usage{
closeness(graph, v=igraph.vs.all(graph), mode = "all")
}
\arguments{
  \item{graph}{The graph to analyze.}
  \item{v}{The vertices for which closeness will be calculated.}
  \item{mode}{Character string, defined the types of the paths used for
    measuring the distance in directed graphs. \dQuote{in} measures the
    paths \emph{to} a vertex, \dQuote{out} measures paths \emph{from} a
    vertex, \emph{all} uses undirected paths. This argument is ignored
    for undirected graphs.}
}
\details{The closeness centrality of a vertex is defined by the inverse
  of the average length of the shortest paths to/from all the other
  vertices in the graph:

  \deqn{(|V|-1)/sum( d(v,i), i != v)}{$$\frac{|V|-1}{\sum_{i\ne v} d_vi}$$}

  If there is no (directed) path between vertex \eqn{\code{v}}{$v$} and
  \eqn{\code{i}}{$i$} then the total number of vertices is used in the
  formula instead of the path length.
}
\value{Numeric vector with te closeness values of all the vertices in
  \code{v}.}
