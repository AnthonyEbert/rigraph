\title{Graph layout with vertices on a circle.}
\usage{
layout_in_circle(graph, order = V(graph))

in_circle(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{The input graph.}

\item{order}{The vertices to place on the circle, in the order of their
desired placement. Vertices that are not included here will be placed at
(0,0).}

\item{...}{Passed to \code{layout_in_circle}.}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix with two columns, and one row for each vertex.
}
\description{
Place vertices on a circle, in the order of their vertex ids.
}
\details{
If you want to order the vertices differently, then permute them using the
\code{\link{permute}} function.
}
\examples{
## Place vertices on a circle, order them according to their
