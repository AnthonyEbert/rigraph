\title{Difference of vertex sequences}
\usage{
\method{difference}{igraph.vs}(big, small, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{big}{The \sQuote{big} vertex sequence.}

\item{small}{The \sQuote{small} vertex sequence.}

\item{...}{Ignored, included for S3 signature compatibility.}
}
\value{
A vertex sequence that contains only vertices that are part of
\code{big}, but not part of \code{small}.
}
\description{
Difference of vertex sequences
}
\details{
They must belong to the same graph. Note that this function has
\sQuote{set} semantics and the multiplicity of vertices is lost in the
result.
