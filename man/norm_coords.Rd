\title{Normalize coordinates for plotting graphs}
\usage{
norm_coords(layout, xmin = -1, xmax = 1, ymin = -1, ymax = 1,
  zmin = -1, zmax = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{layout}{A matrix with two or three columns, the layout to normalize.}

\item{xmin,xmax}{The limits for the first coordinate, if one of them or both
are \code{NULL} then no normalization is performed along this direction.}

\item{ymin,ymax}{The limits for the second coordinate, if one of them or
both are \code{NULL} then no normalization is performed along this
direction.}

\item{zmin,zmax}{The limits for the third coordinate, if one of them or both
are \code{NULL} then no normalization is performed along this direction.}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix with at the same dimension as \code{layout}.
}
\description{
Rescale coordinates linearly to be within given bounds.
}
\details{
\code{norm_coords} normalizes a layout, it linearly transforms each
coordinate separately to fit into the given limits.
