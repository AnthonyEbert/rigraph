\title{Graph layout with vertices on the surface of a sphere}
\usage{
layout_on_sphere(graph)

on_sphere(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{The input graph.}

\item{...}{Passed to \code{layout_on_sphere}.}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix with three columns, and one row for each vertex.
}
\description{
Place vertices on a sphere, approximately uniformly, in the order of their
vertex ids.
}
\details{
\code{layout_on_sphere} places the vertices (approximately) uniformly on the
surface of a sphere, this is thus a 3d layout. It is not clear however what
\dQuote{uniformly on a sphere} means.

If you want to order the vertices differently, then permute them using the
\code{\link{permute}} function.
