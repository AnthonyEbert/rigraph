\usage{
\method{intersection}{igraph.vs}(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{The vertex sequences to take the intersection of.}
}
\value{
A vertex sequence that contains vertices that appear in all
given sequences, each vertex exactly once.

\details{
They must belong to the same graph. Note that this function has
