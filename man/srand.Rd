\title{Set random seed of the C library's RNG}
\usage{
srand(seed)
}
\arguments{
\item{seed}{Numeric scalar, the new random seed. It must be non-negative and
will be converted to an integer.}
}
\value{
\code{NULL}, invisibly.
}
\description{
Set the random seed of the C library's RNG, for a new sequence of
pseudo-random numbers.
}
\details{
Note that this function has nothing to do with R's random number generator,
see \code{set.seed} for that.

Some package (e.g. ngspatial) use internal C code and generate random
numbers using the standard C library's built-in random number generator
instead of using R's RNGs. The \code{srand} function is provided to set the
random seed for these packages. It simply calls the standard C function
\code{srand}, with the supplied integer seed value.

Note that the standard C library's RNGs are typically of very bad quality,
and also slower than R's RNGs. It is not worth using them, really, other
than taking over some legacy C code that already uses them, and that would
be difficult to rewrite to use R's RNGs.
